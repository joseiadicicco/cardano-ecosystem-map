# How to Contribute to the Cardano Ecosystem Map

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this map! Below are the steps to propose adding or modifying ecosystem actors.

## Contribution Process (Via Pull Requests)

We use GitHub Pull Requests (PRs) to manage contributions. The basic workflow is:

1.  **Fork:** Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Branch:** Create a new branch in your fork with a descriptive name (e.g., `add-project-xyz` or `update-ambassador-abc`).
3.  **Edit:** Modify the `data/cardano-actors.json` file in your branch:
    * **Add:** Add a new JSON object to the end of the list (before the final `]`), ensuring you maintain correct JSON syntax (commas between objects, etc.).
    * **Modify:** Find the existing object you want to change and update its values.
4.  **Commit:** Save your changes with a clear commit message (e.g., "feat: Add Project XYZ to map").
5.  **Pull Request (PR):** Open a Pull Request from your branch to the `main` branch of this original repository. In the PR description, briefly explain what you added or modified and provide links or references if possible to verify the information.

## Data Format (`data/cardano-actors.json`)

Each actor in the `data/cardano-actors.json` file is a JSON object with the following fields:

* `lat` (Number): Geographic latitude. (Required)
* `lng` (Number): Geographic longitude. (Required)
    * *You can get approximate coordinates using Google Maps (right-click on a point -> "What's here?").*
* `name` (String): Name of the actor (person, project, hub, etc.). (Required)
* `type` (String): Category of the actor. Current valid values: `Founder`, `Hub`, `University`, `Project`, `Ambassador`. (This list may grow). (Required)
* `city` (String): Main city of location. (Required)
* `country` (String): Country of location. (Required)
* `description` (String): Brief description (1-2 sentences) about the actor or their relevance to Cardano. (Required)
* *(Optional: We might add `url` (String) for a web link, `twitter` (String) for the handle, etc., in the future).*
* `description` (String): Brief description (1-2 sentences)... (Required)
* `twitter` (String): The actor's Twitter handle (username **without** the leading '@'). (Optional)
* `website` (String): The actor's main website URL (including `https://` or `http://`). (Optional)
* `relationship_codes` (Array of numbers/strings): List of codes representing groups or connections this actor belongs to (for future visualization). (Optional)

**Important:** Ensure the entire `cardano-actors.json` file remains valid JSON after your changes. You can use an online JSON validator if unsure.

## Review

A repository maintainer will review your Pull Request. They may ask for changes or clarifications. Once approved, your contribution will be merged and will appear on the map shortly after.
